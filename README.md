## Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- pnpm (recommended) or npm

### Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start development server
pnpm run dev

# Run production container
docker run -p 3000:80 wheelbuilder
```

## Architecture

### Calculation Formula

The spoke length is calculated using the standard bicycle wheel formula:

```
L = âˆš[(r - hÃ—cos(Î¸))Â² + (hÃ—sin(Î¸))Â²]
```

Where:
- `L` = spoke length (mm)
- `r` = rim radius (effective diameter Ã· 2)
- `h` = hub flange radius (flange diameter Ã· 2)
- `Î¸` = cross angle in radians = (cross pattern Ã— 360Â°) Ã· spoke count

## API Reference

### `calculateSpokeLength(specs: WheelSpecs): CalculationResult`

Calculates the required spoke length for given wheel specifications.

**Parameters:**
- `specs.rimEffectiveDiameter` - Rim effective diameter in mm
- `specs.spokeCount` - Number of spokes (must be divisible by 4)
- `specs.crossPattern` - Cross pattern (0-4)
- `specs.hubFlangeDiameter` - Hub flange diameter in mm

**Returns:**
- `spokeLength` - Calculated spoke length in mm (rounded to 1 decimal)
- `isValid` - Whether the calculation is valid
- `errors` - Array of validation error messages

### `validateWheelSpecs(specs: WheelSpecs): string[]`

Validates wheel specifications and returns any errors.

### `getCommonWheelSizes(): Array<{name: string, diameter: number}>`

Returns an array of common wheel sizes for quick selection.
