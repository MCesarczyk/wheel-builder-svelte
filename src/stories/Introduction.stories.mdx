# ðŸš´ Wheelbuilder Storybook

Welcome to the Wheelbuilder component library! This Storybook contains interactive documentation for all components in the Wheelbuilder application.

## What is Wheelbuilder?

Wheelbuilder is a professional bicycle wheel spoke length calculator built with Svelte, TypeScript, and Vite. It provides accurate spoke length calculations using the standard bicycle wheel building formula.

## Key Features

- **Accurate Calculations**: Uses the standard bicycle wheel spoke length formula
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation with helpful error messages  
- **Responsive Design**: Works perfectly on desktop and mobile devices
- **Common Wheel Sizes**: Quick selection buttons for popular wheel sizes
- **Real-time Updates**: Calculations update automatically as you change inputs
- **Professional UI**: Clean, technical design suitable for bike mechanics

## Components

### WheelBuilder
The main calculator component that handles all wheel specifications and spoke length calculations.

### Counter
A simple example component demonstrating basic Svelte reactivity.

## Formula

The spoke length is calculated using the standard bicycle wheel formula:

```
L = âˆš[(r - hÃ—cos(Î¸))Â² + (hÃ—sin(Î¸))Â²]
```

Where:
- `L` = spoke length (mm)
- `r` = rim radius (effective diameter Ã· 2)  
- `h` = hub flange radius (flange diameter Ã· 2)
- `Î¸` = cross angle in radians = (cross pattern Ã— 360Â°) Ã· spoke count
